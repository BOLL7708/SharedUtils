# SharedUtils
Generic classes written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) that should be possible to be used in both JavaScript runtimes and browsers, in theory.

This code is mainly used for my own personal projects, feel free to look at it as reference material, anything in here can change at any time as I adapt things to my own needs.
